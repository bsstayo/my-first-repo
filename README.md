## How to write branch names efficiently
- main/master: Default branch. Protect safely with 'Branch Protection' and set it not to merge directly.
  
- development branch or other stage branch: Following the DevOps model, modeling branches like DEV. UAT. PROD. For example, the 'main' branch is tested on the 'dev' or 'uat' branch, safely deployed on the 'prod/release' branch, and then merge.
  
- feature-xxx branch: Used to add new features, but set not directly merge to the main/master branch. Works with project management tasks such as JIRA.
  
- hotfix-xxx branch: Branches for fixing critical errors or bugs in Production environments. Feature branches can also be linked to project management tasks such as JIRA.

## Various Git Branch Model
**1. GitHub flow**

Only main and feature branches.

**2. GitLab flow**

Similar to GitHub Flow, but has a separate production branch for deployment.

**3. Trunk-based**

Some fixed-lasting branches, and merge in the same main branch.

**4. GitFlow**

The most commonly used branch model in the company. In the main branch, only the hotfix branch can change, and the feature branch merges with the development branch
